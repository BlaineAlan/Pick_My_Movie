## Pick_My_Movie

# Project Name: 

    Pick My Movie

# What is the goal of this project:

    The goal of this project is to use a core database of movies on imdb, which includes ratings, directors, summaries, genres, etc. and, using a GUI, allow the user to make an account, search that dataset and be matched with movies that fit the description. Using an additional dataset for movie posters, the user can see the poster for the movie, and using a dataset for streaming platforms the user can see what platforms they can watch the movie on. Then the user can write reviews for movies they've watched. Using analytics the user can be recommended movies that match what they've watched recently, see the most popular movies, and see the best movies for each streaming platform.

# What interaction does this app provide:

    The user can make an account, search for movies, leave reviews, and interact with various analytics to find even more movies they may find interesting.

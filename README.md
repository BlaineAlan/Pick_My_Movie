# What is the goal of this project:

The goal of this project is to use a core database of movies on imdb, which includes ratings, directors, summaries, genres, etc. and, using a GUI, allow the user to make an account, search that dataset and be matched with movies that fit the description. Using an additional dataset for movie streaming platforms, they can see which platforms to watch the movie on. They can also see an additional rating from another source, rottem tomatoes, from the same dataset. Then the user can write reviews for movies they've watched. Using analytics the user can be recommended movies that match what they've reviewed recently. All actions (signing up, logging in, leaving and deleting reviews) are logged into the audit_log.csv file.

# What interaction does this app provide:

The user can make an account, search for movies, leave reviews, and interact with recommended movies to find even more movies to watch.
